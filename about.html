            Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that while healthcare workers
            were risking their lives taking care of those affected and they were
            inundated with calls from families, who were seeking updates as they
            were unable to visit their loved ones in hospitals. .
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class ="page-para">
            The NHS was ill prepared for such a problem and the lack of an
            efficient communication system for hospitals became highlighted.
            Families have a right to know about the developments of their loved
            ones and have access to their data upon request and that is why we
            came up with Patient Progress.
